🔹 Java Control Statements

Control statements decide flow of execution in a program.

Types

1️⃣ Conditional statements
2️⃣ Looping statements
3️⃣ Jump statements

1️⃣ Conditional Statements
✅ if statement
Interview Point: Executes block only if condition is true.

✅ if–else
Interview Question:
❓ Can else exist without if?
👉 ❌ No

✅ else if ladder
Interview Tip: Conditions checked top to bottom.

✅ switch statement
Important Interview Points
break avoids fall-through
Supports int, char, String (not float, double)


2️⃣ Looping Statements
🔁 for loop
Best for: Fixed number of iterations

🔁 while loop
Best for: Condition-based looping

🔁 do–while loop
Interview Trap Question:
❓ Will it execute at least once?
👉 ✅ YES


3️⃣ Jump Statements
🔸 break
🔸 continue

🔥 Most Asked Interview Questions
❓ Difference between for and while?
for → known iterations
while → unknown iterations

❓ Difference between while and do-while?
while → checks condition first
do-while → executes at least once

❓ Can switch work without break?
👉 Yes, but causes fall-through

🧠 One-Line Interview Revision
✔ if → condition check
✔ switch → multiple choices
✔ for → fixed loop
✔ while → condition loop
✔ do-while → runs once minimum

🎯 Practice (Very Important)
1️⃣ Print numbers 1–100
2️⃣ Check prime number
3️⃣ Reverse a number
4️⃣ Fibonacci series
5️⃣ Factorial using loop


🔹 OOP Concepts (Java)
1️⃣ Class & Object

✅ Class
A class is a blueprint/template from which objects are created.

✅ Object
An object is a real instance of a class.

Class is logical, object is physical.

2️⃣ Constructor
✅ What is Constructor?
A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects.
Rules
✔ Same name as class
✔ No return type
✔ Automatically called

3️⃣ this Keyword
✅ Purpose
this refers to the current object.
Uses
✔ Distinguish instance & local variables
✔ Call current class constructor
✔ Pass current object

this removes confusion between instance and local variables.

4️⃣ Encapsulation (Getter / Setter)
✅ What is Encapsulation?
Wrapping data + methods into a single unit and hiding data using private.
Benefits
✔ Data security
✔ Controlled access
✔ Maintainability

❓ What is OOP?
✅ Answer
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming approach based on objects, which contain data and behavior.
👉 Key pillars:
Class, Object, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction

❓ Why Encapsulation?
✅ Answer
Encapsulation is used to protect data, hide implementation details, and provide controlled access using getters and setters.
👉 Improves security & maintainability.

❓ Difference between Class & Object?
| Class     | Object      |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Blueprint | Real entity |
| Logical   | Physical    |
| No memory | Uses memory |
| Single    | Multiple    |

👉 Example:
Class = Car
Object = BMW, Audi

🧠 One-Line Interview Revision
✔ Class → blueprint
✔ Object → instance
✔ Constructor → initialize object
✔ this → current object
✔ Encapsulation → data hiding
