🔹 Inheritance & Polymorphism (Java)
1️⃣ Inheritance
✅ What is Inheritance?
Inheritance is a mechanism where one class acquires the properties and methods of another class.
👉 Keyword used: extends

🔑 Interview Points
✔ Code reusability
✔ IS-A relationship
✔ Supports method overriding

❌ Multiple Inheritance in Java?
❌ Not supported using classes
✅ Supported using interfaces

2️⃣ Types of Inheritance (Interview Theory)
| Type                 | Java Support |
| -------------------- | ------------ |
| Single               | ✅            |
| Multilevel           | ✅            |
| Hierarchical         | ✅            |
| Multiple (class)     | ❌            |
| Multiple (interface) | ✅            |

2️⃣ Polymorphism
✅ What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism means one method, many forms.
👉 Achieved using:
Method Overloading (compile-time)
Method Overriding (runtime)

🔁 Method Overloading (Compile-Time Polymorphism)
🔑 Interview Points
✔ Same method name
✔ Different parameters
✔ Same class

🔄 Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)
🔑 Interview Points
✔ Same method signature
✔ Different class (IS-A)
✔ Runtime decision

⚠ Very Important Interview Difference
Overloading vs Overriding
| Feature      | Overloading  | Overriding |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| Polymorphism | Compile-time | Runtime    |
| Parameters   | Must differ  | Same       |
| Inheritance  | Not required | Required   |
| Method call  | Compile time | Runtime    |


❓ Why Java does not support multiple inheritance?
To avoid Diamond Problem.

❓ What is super keyword?
Used to refer parent class object, variables, and constructors.

❓ Can we override static method?
❌ No (method hiding, not overriding)

🧠 One-Line Interview Revision
✔ Inheritance → IS-A
✔ Polymorphism → many forms
✔ Overloading → compile-time
✔ Overriding → runtime
✔ extends → inheritance

🔹 Abstraction & Interface (Java)
1️⃣ Abstraction
✅ What is Abstraction?
Abstraction means hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.
👉 Focus on what object does, not how it does.

🔹 How to achieve Abstraction in Java?
1️⃣ Abstract class
2️⃣ Interface

🧩 Abstract Class
✅ Features
✔ Can have abstract & non-abstract methods
✔ Cannot be instantiated
✔ Can have constructors
✔ Can have instance variables

🔑 Interview Line
👉 Abstract class gives partial abstraction.


2️⃣ Interface
✅ What is Interface?
An interface is a 100% abstraction blueprint (till Java 7).

Features
✔ Supports multiple inheritance
✔ Methods are public abstract by default
✔ Variables are public static final
✔ No constructor

🔥 Abstract Class vs Interface (Interview Favorite)
| Feature              | Abstract Class      | Interface                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Methods              | Abstract + concrete | Abstract (default allowed Java 8+) |
| Variables            | Instance allowed    | public static final                |
| Multiple inheritance | ❌                   | ✅                                  |
| Constructor          | ✅                   | ❌                                  |
| Access               | Any                 | public only                        |


⚠ Java 8+ Interface Update (IMP)
Interface can have:
✔ default methods
✔ static methods

🎯 Interview Questions & Answers
❓ Why use abstraction?
✔ Reduce complexity
✔ Increase security
✔ Improve flexibility

❓ Can abstract class have constructor?
✅ Yes (used for initialization)

❓ Can interface have variables?
✅ Yes, but they are public static final

❓ Can we create object of abstract class or interface?
❌ No

🧠 One-Line Interview Revision
✔ Abstraction → hide implementation
✔ Abstract class → partial abstraction
✔ Interface → full abstraction
✔ Interface → multiple inheritance

⭐ Final Interview Summary (Memorize This)
Encapsulation ≠ getters/setters
Encapsulation = data hiding + controlled access
Private constructor prevents new keyword usage
Singleton ensures single object creation


🔥 CLASS & OBJECT – Tricky Questions
1️⃣ What is the difference between Class and Object?
Answer:
Class → blueprint, logical, no memory
Object → real entity, physical, occupies memory
👉 Trick: Class loads once, objects can be many.

2️⃣ Can a class exist without objects?
✅ Yes
Example: utility classes like Math, System

3️⃣ Can object exist without class?
❌ No (Except JVM internal objects)

4️⃣ How many times class is loaded in JVM?
✅ Only once per classloader

5️⃣ Can a class be declared final?
✅ Yes → cannot be inherited

🔥 ENCAPSULATION – Tricky Questions
6️⃣ What is encapsulation in one line?
Answer:
Wrapping data + methods and hiding data using private access.

7️⃣ Is encapsulation possible without getters/setters?
✅ Yes
But getters/setters provide controlled access.

8️⃣ Why variables are kept private?
✔ Data security
✔ Validation
✔ Read-only / write-only access

9️⃣ Is encapsulation same as data hiding?
❌ No
| Encapsulation | Data Hiding           |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| Concept       | Technique             |
| Uses class    | Uses access modifiers |

🔟 Can we achieve encapsulation without OOP?
❌ No

🔥 INHERITANCE – Tricky Questions
1️⃣1️⃣ Why Java does NOT support multiple inheritance with classes?
👉 To avoid Diamond Problem

1️⃣2️⃣ What is IS-A relationship?
Inheritance relationship
ex.
Dog extends Animal

1️⃣3️⃣ Can constructor be inherited?
❌ No
But can be called using super()

1️⃣4️⃣ Can private members be inherited?
❌ No (but accessible via public methods)

1️⃣5️⃣ Can we reduce visibility while overriding?
❌ No
✔ Can increase visibility only

1️⃣6️⃣ Can final method be overridden?
❌ No

1️⃣7️⃣ Can static method be overridden?
❌ No → Method Hiding

🔥 POLYMORPHISM – Tricky Questions
1️⃣8️⃣ What is polymorphism in one line?
One method, many forms

1️⃣9️⃣ Difference between overloading & overriding?
| Overloading       | Overriding     |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Compile-time      | Runtime        |
| Same class        | Parent-child   |
| Parameters differ | Same signature |

2️⃣0️⃣ Can we overload main method?

✅ Yes
But JVM calls only:
Ex.
public static void main(String[] args)

2️⃣1️⃣ Can we override main method?
❌ No (static method)

2️⃣2️⃣ Why overriding is runtime polymorphism?
Because JVM decides method call at runtime based on object.

2️⃣3️⃣ What is upcasting?
ex.
Parent p = new Child();
✔ Used for runtime polymorphism

2️⃣4️⃣ What is downcasting?
ex.
Child c = (Child) p;
⚠ Risky → ClassCastException


🔥 ABSTRACTION – Tricky Questions
2️⃣5️⃣ What is abstraction in simple words?
Showing what, hiding how

2️⃣6️⃣ Difference between abstraction & encapsulation?
| Abstraction                    | Encapsulation           |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Design level                   | Implementation level    |
| What                           | How                     |
| Achieved by abstract/interface | private + getter/setter |

2️⃣7️⃣ Can abstract class have constructor?
✅ Yes (for initialization)

2️⃣8️⃣ Can abstract class have non-abstract methods?
✅ Yes

2️⃣9️⃣ Can interface have constructor?
❌ No

3️⃣0️⃣ Can interface have variables?
✅ Yes → public static final only

👉 Abstract = partial abstraction
👉 Interface = full abstraction

❌ No

3️⃣5️⃣ Can we create reference of abstract class?
✅ Yes

3️⃣6️⃣ Can constructor be private?
✅ Yes (Singleton pattern)

✔ Access parent members
✔ Call parent constructor

👉 Encapsulation

4️⃣0️⃣ Which OOP concept improves code reuse?
👉 Inheritance
