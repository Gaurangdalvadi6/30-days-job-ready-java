❓ What is PRIMARY KEY?
Answer (Interview Ready):
A Primary Key is a column (or combination of columns) that uniquely identifies each record in a table.
It cannot be NULL and must be unique.
ex.
id INT PRIMARY KEY

❓ Difference between DELETE & TRUNCATE
| Feature       | DELETE     | TRUNCATE       |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Type          | DML        | DDL            |
| WHERE allowed | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No           |
| Rollback      | ✅ Possible | ❌ Not possible |
| Speed         | Slower     | Faster         |
| Deletes rows  | One by one | All at once    |
DELETE removes rows conditionally and can be rolled back, whereas TRUNCATE removes all rows permanently and resets the table.

❓ DELETE vs DROP
DELETE → removes rows
TRUNCATE → removes all rows
DROP → removes entire table

🧠 HOW THIS CONNECTS TO SPRING BOOT
These SQL queries are written in:
JPA Repository
@Query annotation
Native Queries
Tables → @Entity
Primary Key → @Id

❓ Difference between CHAR vs VARCHAR (TRAP 🔥)
| CHAR                  | VARCHAR         |
| --------------------- | --------------- |
| Fixed length          | Variable length |
| Faster for fixed data | Saves space     |
| Wastes memory         | Efficient       |
Use CHAR when data length is fixed (like gender, country code).
Use VARCHAR when length varies (name, email).

❓ INT vs BIGINT (TRAP)
| INT            | BIGINT            |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| 4 bytes        | 8 bytes           |
| Max ~2 billion | Very large values |
Salary may fit in INT today but not tomorrow → use BIGINT for safety.

❓ Can PRIMARY KEY be NULL?
❌ NO
❓ Can UNIQUE be NULL?
✅ YES (multiple NULLs allowed)
Primary key ensures entity identity, unique ensures data constraint.

❓ PRIMARY KEY vs UNIQUE (TRAP 🔥)
| Primary Key             | Unique              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| One per table           | Multiple allowed    |
| Not NULL                | Can be NULL         |
| Creates clustered index | Non-clustered index |

❓ What is INDEX?
Index improves SELECT performance by reducing full table scan.
Index slows down INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

❓ When NOT to use Index?
Small tables
Columns frequently updated
Low cardinality (gender)

❓ Can DELETE be rolled back?
✅ Yes (if transaction)

❓ Can TRUNCATE be rolled back?
❌ No

❓ Why TRUNCATE is faster?
It deallocates pages instead of deleting row-by-row.

❓ Difference between WHERE and HAVING?
| WHERE                | HAVING              |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Filters rows         | Filters groups      |
| Used before GROUP BY | Used after GROUP BY |
| Cannot use aggregate | Can use aggregate   |
ex.
SELECT dept_id, COUNT(*)
FROM employee
GROUP BY dept_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;
note: WHERE works on rows, HAVING works on aggregated data.

❓ INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN
| INNER JOIN         | LEFT JOIN           |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Matching rows only | All left table rows |
| Faster             | Slightly slower     |
ex.
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name
FROM employee e
LEFT JOIN department d
ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

❓ What happens if JOIN condition is missing?
💥 CARTESIAN PRODUCT (TRAP)
ex.
SELECT * FROM employee, department;
👉 Rows = emp_count × dept_count

❓ What is normalization?
Process of reducing data redundancy.

❓ 1NF, 2NF, 3NF (FRESHER LEVEL)
1NF → No multiple values in column
2NF → No partial dependency
3NF → No transitive dependency
⚠️ Trap:
Over-normalization can hurt performance.

❓ What is ACID?
| A | Atomicity |
| C | Consistency |
| I | Isolation |
| D | Durability |
ex.
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE account SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE account SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;

❓ What is Isolation Level? (INTERVIEW FAVORITE)
READ UNCOMMITTED
READ COMMITTED
REPEATABLE READ (MySQL default)
SERIALIZABLE
⚠️ Trap:
Higher isolation = safer but slower.

SUBQUERY vs JOIN (TRAP)
❓ Which is faster?
👉 JOIN is usually faster

🚀 SPRING BOOT CONNECTION (VERY IMPORTANT)
Table → @Entity
PK → @Id
JOIN → @ManyToOne
Transaction → @Transactional
Index → @Index

Types of Constraints
PRIMARY KEY
FOREIGN KEY
UNIQUE
NOT NULL
CHECK
DEFAULT

FOREIGN KEY & REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY
ex.
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
