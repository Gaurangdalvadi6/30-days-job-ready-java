📦 Serialization & Deserialization

1️⃣ What is Serialization?
✅ Interview Answer
Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream so it can be:
saved to a file
sent over network
stored permanently
👉 Reverse process = Deserialization

2️⃣ Why Serialization is Needed?
✔ Save object state
✔ Data transfer
✔ Caching
✔ Persistence

3️⃣ Serializable Interface
Marker interface (no methods)
Present in java.io
JVM uses it to allow serialization

4️⃣ transient Keyword (VERY IMPORTANT)
✅ Purpose
Prevents variable from being serialized
Used for passwords / sensitive data
ex.
transient String password;
Interview Line
👉 Transient fields are ignored during serialization.

5️⃣ Is Serialization secure?
❌ No
👉 Use encryption + transient

6️⃣ Can static variables be serialized?
❌ No (belong to class)

7️⃣ Difference: Serialization vs Deserialization
| Serialization | Deserialization |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| Object → file | File → object   |
| writeObject() | readObject()    |
| Save state    | Restore state   |

8️⃣ serialVersionUID (INTERVIEW TRAP)
ex.
private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
Why?
✔ Version control
✔ Avoid InvalidClassException

9️⃣ What Happens If Class Is NOT Serializable?
Exception in thread "main"
java.io.NotSerializableException

❓ Can constructor run during deserialization?
❌ No

❓ Can transient variable be restored?
✅ Yes, manually (after deserialization)

❓ Serializable vs Externalizable?
| Serializable | Externalizable    |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| Automatic    | Manual            |
| Easy         | Fast & controlled |
| Less control | Full control      |


🧠 One-Line Interview Revision (MEMORIZE 🔥)
Serialization → object → byte stream
Deserialization → byte stream → object
Deserialization → constructor NOT called
Serializable → marker interface
transient → skip field
serialVersionUID → version control

Multithreading (Thread vs Runnable)
🔹 What is Multithreading?
Running multiple tasks simultaneously using multiple threads.
👉 Improves performance and CPU utilization.

🔹 Thread vs Runnable (INTERVIEW FAVORITE)
1️⃣ Extending Thread
2️⃣ Implementing Runnable (BEST PRACTICE)

🔥 Difference Table
| Thread              | Runnable             |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Extends class       | Implements interface |
| No inheritance left | Supports inheritance |
| Less flexible       | More flexible ✅      |
| Not preferred       | Preferred            |

🎤 Interview Line
Runnable is preferred because Java supports single inheritance.

🔒 Synchronization (VERY IMPORTANT)
👉 Prevents race condition.

🎯 Multithreading Interview Traps
Call start() → creates new thread
Call run() → normal method
sleep() → pause thread
join() → wait for thread

🧠 FINAL QUICK REVISION (MEMORIZE 🔥)
Multithreading
Runnable > Thread
start() ≠ run()
synchronized → thread safety

Java 8
Stream → clean processing
filter + map + collect
Lazy execution

Spring Boot
Controller = entry
Service = business logic
Repository = DB access
DI = polymorphism
