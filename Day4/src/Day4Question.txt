✅ PART 1: Exception Handling
1️⃣ try – catch
What is Exception?
An unexpected runtime error that stops normal program flow.
2️⃣ Multiple Catch
👉 Specific → General
3️⃣ Custom Exception
When to use?
When business rules fail.


✅ PART 2: Collections Framework
🔹 Why Collections over Array? (VERY IMPORTANT)
| Array            | Collections       |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Fixed size       | Dynamic size      |
| No methods       | Rich methods      |
| Homogeneous      | Can store objects |
| No ready sorting | Sorting/searching |
👉 Interview Line: Collections are flexible and powerful.

🔹 List Interface (ArrayList)
Store users dynamically

🔹 Map Interface (HashMap)
Store user data as key-value

🔹 List
Allows duplicates
Maintains insertion order
Index-based access
Use case
👉 When order matters (users list, products)

🔹 Set
❌ No duplicates
❌ No index
Unordered (HashSet)

Use case
👉 Unique data (email IDs, roll numbers)


Example

🎯 INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
❓ Checked vs Unchecked Exception
| Checked           | Unchecked                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Compile-time      | Runtime                  |
| Must handle       | Optional                 |
| IOException       | NullPointerException     |
| extends Exception | extends RuntimeException |
👉 Interview Line: Checked exceptions are checked at compile time.

❓ Why Map is used?
✅ Answer
Map is used to store data in key–value pairs for fast searching.
🔑 Benefits
✔ No duplicate keys
✔ Fast lookup
✔ Real-world mapping

🔥 Interview Comparison Table
| Feature      | List   | Set  | Map     |
| ------------ | ------ | ---- | ------- |
| Duplicate    | ✅      | ❌    | ❌ (key) |
| Order        | ✅      | ❌    | ❌       |
| Access       | Index  | ❌    | Key     |
| Search speed | Medium | Fast | Fastest |

Java 8 – Lambda & Stream (INTERVIEW FAVORITE)
🔹 Lambda Expression
Interview Line
👉 Lambda reduces boilerplate code.

🔹 Stream API
✔ Filter
✔ Sort
✔ Map
✔ Reduce

🧠 One-Line Interview Revision
✔ try-catch → handle runtime error
✔ custom exception → business rules
✔ List → ordered collection
✔ Map → key-value storage

🧠 FINAL DAY 4 REVISION (MEMORIZE 🔥)
try-catch → runtime safety
custom exception → business rules
List → ordered data
Set → unique data
Map → fast search
Java 8 → clean & functional code


📁 File Handling (Java)
1️⃣ What is File Handling?
✅ Interview Answer
File handling is used to store data permanently in a file instead of memory (RAM).
👉 Data remains even after program ends.

2️⃣ File Class (java.io)
Used to:
Create file
Check existence
Get file info

3️⃣ Write Data to File
✍ Using FileWriter
🔑 Interview Points
✔ .write() method Overwrites existing data
✔ Must close file

4️⃣ Append Data to File
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("data.txt", true);
true is define data append

5️⃣ Read Data from File
📖 Using FileReader

6️⃣ Better Way: BufferedReader
🔑 Why BufferedReader?
✔ Faster
✔ Reads line by line

🎯 INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
❓ Why file handling is needed?
✔ Permanent storage
✔ Large data handling
✔ Data sharing

❓ Difference: FileWriter vs BufferedWriter?
| FileWriter      | BufferedWriter   |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| Writes directly | Writes in buffer |
| Slower          | Faster           |
| Simple          | Efficient        |

❓ Checked or Unchecked Exception?
👉 File handling throws Checked Exceptions (IOException)

❓ What is try-with-resources?
Automatically closes resources.

❓ Can Java read/write binary files?
✅ Yes → FileInputStream, FileOutputStream

🧠 One-Line Interview Revision
✔ File → permanent storage
✔ FileWriter → write text
✔ FileReader → read text
✔ BufferedReader → fast reading
✔ IOException → checked exception
